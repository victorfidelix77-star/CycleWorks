# CycleWorks

A blockchain-powered waste management tracking platform that ensures transparent, accountable, and incentivized waste collection, recycling, and disposal processes using decentralized technology.

---

## Overview

CycleWorks leverages blockchain to create a decentralized system for tracking waste from collection to disposal or recycling, addressing issues like illegal dumping, lack of transparency, and inefficient recycling processes. The platform uses 4 smart contracts built with Clarity to ensure trust, traceability, and incentivization for all stakeholders—municipalities, waste collectors, recyclers, and citizens.

1. **Waste Tracking Contract** – Records waste collection and movement on-chain.
2. **Recycler Rewards Contract** – Incentivizes recycling through token rewards.
3. **Compliance Verification Contract** – Ensures regulatory compliance for waste disposal.
4. **Citizen Reporting Contract** – Enables citizens to report illegal dumping or issues.
